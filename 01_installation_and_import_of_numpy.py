# Numpy is used for the array operation,mathemetical ,logical ,furior transformation ,linear algebra ,matrics by using the numpy functions
# Numpy array is fater than the python list because Numpy array stored continueos into the memory 

# Numpy code is written partially in python and also for fast computation some code is written into the c/c++

# ********* pip install numpy - used for install numpy in your system (pip uninstall numpy - used for the uninstall numpy into the system)
# pip list - check which libraries exist into your system

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1 ,2 ,5 ,7 ,8])  # Here we are given list as array

print(arr)
print(type(arr))

# You can also print version of the numpy module

print(np.__version__)

# NumPy Array is only stored the same types of data where list stored any types of data into the list also list is one dimesional

# You can also used numpy for the image visulization and image reader - Numerical operation

# Modification of data into the numpy is slow than list because in list many function is exist for direct modification
